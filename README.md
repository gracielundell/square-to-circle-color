practicing javaScript and jQuery: turning squares on a grid to the color of set circles

###By Gracie Lundell

##Description
A rough draft of an interactive grid made using JavaScript that allows users to plan their summer garden. Users may click on vegetables at the bottom of the page to select them, and then click on a square in the grid to place that image in a square, symbolizing where they would put it in relation to other plants in their physical garden.

##Setup
To view this webpage and the code behind it, clone this repository. Then open it using the text editor of your choice. Once opened, drag the <code>index.html</code> tab into the header of your web browser.
The grid may also be accessed through its GitHub Page, [here](http://gracielundell.com/square-to-circle-color/).
